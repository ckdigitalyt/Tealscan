# Replit Agent Prompt: TealScan Production-Ready Improvements

## Context

This is a mutual fund portfolio analyzer app. PDF parsing MUST happen at frontend for data privacy (client-side processing is our key USP). Heavy computational analysis can happen at backend via API routes. We’re using Next.js 14 with TypeScript.

## Architecture Principles

- **Frontend**: PDF parsing, file handling, all user data processing (privacy-first)
- **Backend**: Heavy computations (XIRR calculations, fund comparisons, overlap detection), external API calls, non-sensitive operations
- Keep all sensitive portfolio data in browser memory only, never send to backend

## Task 1: Add Demo Mode with Sample Report

**Location**: `src/app/page.tsx`

**Requirements**:

1. Add a “View Sample Report” button (variant=“outline”) next to the existing “Reveal Hidden Fees” / “Analyze My Portfolio” button in the hero section
1. When clicked, populate the `data` state with this hardcoded dummy portfolio:
   
   ```typescript
   const sampleData = {
     totalInvestment: 5000000, // ₹50L
     currentValue: 5500000,
     totalReturns: 500000,
     xirr: 12.5,
     totalExpenseRatio: 0.85,
     annualFees: 15000, // ₹15k
     funds: [
       {
         name: "HDFC Flexi Cap Fund - Direct",
         amount: 1500000,
         expenseRatio: 0.65,
         returns: 15.2,
         category: "Flexi Cap"
       },
       {
         name: "Parag Parikh Flexi Cap - Regular",
         amount: 1200000,
         expenseRatio: 2.15,
         returns: 14.8,
         category: "Flexi Cap",
         warning: "Switch to Direct Plan - Save ₹18,000/year"
       },
       {
         name: "Axis Bluechip Fund - Direct",
         amount: 1000000,
         expenseRatio: 0.55,
         returns: 13.5,
         category: "Large Cap"
       },
       {
         name: "Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip - Direct",
         amount: 800000,
         expenseRatio: 0.75,
         returns: 16.8,
         category: "Large & Mid Cap"
       },
       {
         name: "Kotak Small Cap Fund - Direct",
         amount: 500000,
         expenseRatio: 1.05,
         returns: 18.5,
         category: "Small Cap"
       }
     ],
     overlaps: [
       {
         stock: "Reliance Industries",
         funds: ["HDFC Flexi Cap", "Parag Parikh Flexi Cap", "Axis Bluechip"],
         totalExposure: 8.5
       }
     ],
     recommendations: [
       "Switch Parag Parikh Flexi Cap from Regular to Direct - Save ₹18,000 annually",
       "High overlap detected in Large Cap stocks - Consider diversifying",
       "Your portfolio is overweight in Flexi Cap (54%) - Consider rebalancing"
     ]
   };
   ```
1. Set `isAnalyzing` to `false` immediately (no loading state for demo)
1. Scroll to results section automatically after setting data
1. Add a small badge/tag on the results that says “Demo Data” when in demo mode
1. Store a state variable `isDemoMode` to track this

-----

## Task 2: Smart Loading State with Dynamic Messages

**Location**: `src/app/page.tsx`

**Requirements**:

1. Replace the static “Analyzing your portfolio…” text with a cycling message system
1. Create an array of messages:
   
   ```typescript
   const loadingMessages = [
     "🔐 Decrypting your portfolio...",
     "📊 Analyzing fund performance...",
     "🧮 Calculating XIRR returns...",
     "🔍 Detecting overlaps...",
     "💰 Finding hidden charges...",
     "✨ Generating recommendations..."
   ];
   ```
1. Cycle through these messages every 2.5 seconds while `isAnalyzing` is `true`
1. Use `useEffect` with `setInterval` to update the displayed message
1. Clean up the interval when analysis completes
1. Show the current message with a smooth fade transition between changes

-----

## Task 3: Add Professional Footer

-----

## Task 4: Add SEO Meta Tags

**Location**: `src/app/layout.tsx` or `src/app/page.tsx`

       description: "Stop losing ₹75K to hidden charges. Privacy-first portfolio analysis.",
       type: "website",
     },
   };
   ```
1. If using app router, ensure this is in the page.tsx file
1. Add proper TypeScript import: `import type { Metadata } from 'next'`

-----

## Task 5: Improve Upload Experience

**Location**: `src/app/page.tsx` - Upload section

**Requirements**:

1. Add helper text below the file upload input:

-----

## Task 6: Add FAQ Section

**Location**: `src/app/page.tsx` - Add before footer, after testimonials

**Requirements**:

1. Create an FAQ accordion/expandable section with these Q&As:
   
   **Q: Is this really free?**
   A: Yes, 100% free. No hidden costs, no premium plans. We believe every investor deserves access to portfolio insights.
   
   **Q: Is my data safe? Do you store my portfolio information?**
   A: Your data never leaves your browser. All PDF parsing and analysis happens client-side in your browser. We never upload, store, or see your portfolio data. Check our Privacy Policy for details.
   
   **Q: What file formats do you support?**
   A: We support CAMS/Karvy consolidated statements in PDF format (with or without password), Excel files (.xlsx), and CSV files.
   
   **Q: How accurate are the calculations?**
   A: We use industry-standard formulas for XIRR, expense ratio calculations, and overlap detection. Our data comes from official AMC disclosures. However, this tool is for informational purposes only - not financial advice.
   
   **Q: Can I use this for stocks, bonds, or ETFs?**
   A: Currently, we only support Indian mutual funds. Stock portfolio analysis is coming soon!
   
   **Q: What should I do with the recommendations?**
   A: Our recommendations are insights, not advice. We suggest consulting a SEBI-registered investment advisor before making any switches or changes to your portfolio.

**Requirements**:

1. Add specific error messages for common scenarios:
   
   ```typescript
   const errorMessages = {
     fileTooBig: "File is too large. Maximum size: 10MB. Try a smaller date range.",
     invalidFormat: "This doesn't look like a CAMS/Karvy statement. Need help finding it?",
     passwordRequired: "This PDF is password protected. Please enter the password below.",
     passwordIncorrect: "Incorrect password. Please try again.",
     parsingFailed: "Unable to parse this file. Please ensure it's a valid CAMS/Karvy statement.",
     noData: "No mutual fund transactions found in this file. Please check the file and try again."
   };
   ```
1. Show errors in a prominent but non-intrusive way (toast notification or alert box)
1. Add a “Try Again” button when errors occur
1. Add a “Contact Support” link for persistent issues
1. Log errors to console for debugging (use console.error with detailed context)

-----

   ```
1. Use a split-screen card design with contrasting colors
1. Add animation when scrolling into view
1. Make it visually prominent to drive home the value proposition

-----

## Task 9: Progress Indicator During Analysis

**Location**: `src/app/page.tsx` - Loading state UI

**Requirements**:

1. Replace simple loading spinner with a step-by-step progress indicator:
   
   ```
   ✓ PDF Parsed (1/5)
   → Calculating Returns (2/5)
     Analyzing Expenses (3/5)
     Detecting Overlaps (4/5)
     Generating Report (5/5)
   ```
1. Show actual progress through these steps (not just visual)
1. Each step should take realistic time (e.g., PDF parsing might take 2s, calculations 3s, etc.)
1. Use a progress bar showing percentage completion
1. Add the cycling messages from Task 2 below the progress steps

-----

## Task 10: Mobile Optimization

1. Test the results dashboard is scrollable and readable on mobile
1. Add proper viewport meta tag if not already present

-----

## General Guidelines for Replit Agent:

1. **Preserve existing functionality** - Don’t break the PDF parsing or analysis logic
1. **Use existing UI components** - Keep consistent with current Button, Card, etc. components
1. **Maintain TypeScript types** - Add proper types for all new state variables and functions
1. **Keep it clean** - Remove any console.logs after debugging
1. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure demo mode, real analysis, and error states all work

1. SEO Meta Tags (Task 4) - Critical for discoverability
1. Footer (Task 3) - Professional appearance
