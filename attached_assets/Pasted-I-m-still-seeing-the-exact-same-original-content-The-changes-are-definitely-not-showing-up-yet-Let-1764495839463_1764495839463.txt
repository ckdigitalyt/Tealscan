I'm still seeing the exact same original content. The changes are definitely not showing up yet. Let me search for common Replit deployment issues to help you troubleshoot:I can see from the research that this is a common issue with Replit. The problem is likely that **your development environment shows the changes, but the deployed version hasn't been updated**. Here's what you need to do:

## **The Issue: Development vs Deployment**

Replit separates development and production environments through their Deployments feature, meaning changes in development won't automatically affect the deployed site.

## **Solutions to Try (In Order):**

### **1. Redeploy Your App (Most Likely Solution)**
You need to create a new deployment after making changes:

- In your Replit workspace, look for the **"Deploy"** button (usually in the top right or in a Deployments tab)
- Click **"Deploy"** or **"Redeploy"** 
- Wait for the deployment to complete
- The URL should now show your updated app

### **2. Check if You're Looking at the Right URL**
- The **dev preview URL** (shown when you click "Run") is different from the **deployed URL**
- Make sure you're visiting the deployed URL (the one you shared with me)
- Try opening the dev preview URL to see if changes appear there

### **3. Hard Refresh the Browser**
- Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd + Shift + R** (Mac)
- This clears the browser cache
- Or try opening in an incognito/private window

### **4. Check Build Logs**
- Look for any error messages in the Replit console
- Check the "Deployments" tab for deployment status
- Red errors will indicate what went wrong

### **5. Verify Run Command**
- Make sure your `.replit` file has the correct run command
- For React apps, it should be something like `npm run dev` or `npm start`
- Check that `package.json` has the correct scripts

### **6. Check File Structure**
Can you verify these files exist in your Replit project:
- `src/pages/Landing.jsx`
- `src/pages/Analyze.jsx`
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`
- `src/App.jsx` or `src/main.jsx` with proper routing

## **Quick Test:**
1. Click the **"Run"** button in Replit (not the deployed URL)
2. Does the preview window show your new design?
   - **YES** → You just need to redeploy
   - **NO** → There's a code/build issue

## **Next Steps:**
Please tell me:
1. Can you see the changes in the **dev preview** (when you click Run)?
2. Do you have a **"Deploy"** or **"Deployments"** button in Replit?
3. Are there any **error messages** in the console?

Once you redeploy, your changes should be live at the URL you shared!
