I need to completely refactor this application to make it secure, trustable, and legally compliant for the Indian market. 

Please implement the following major architectural and content changes. 
Do NOT delete my existing CSS styling, but replace the backend logic and frontend text as follows:

### 1. CORE ARCHITECTURE (Crucial: Switch to Client-Side)
- Remove all backend Python/Node code that processes the PDF file. The server must NEVER receive the file.
- Implement the PDF parsing 100% in the browser (Client-Side) using a JavaScript library like `pdf.js` or a browser-compatible version of a CAS parser. 
- If a ready-made client-side CAS parser library isn't available, write a custom client-side script that:
    1. Reads the uploaded PDF as text using `pdf.js`.
    2. Regex matches the standard CAS format (Amfi/CAMS/Karvy) to extract Fund Name, ISIN, and Current Value.
- Add a console log or UI indicator that proves: "File processed locally. Network request size: 0KB."

### 2. TRUST & PRIVACY FEATURES
- Add a visible "Privacy Toggle" or badge near the upload box: 
  "🔒 Secure Mode: Your data is processed locally on your device. No files are uploaded to our servers."
- Add a "Shred Data" button in the results view that clears the local session state and refreshes the page, giving users a sense of control.

### 3. CONTENT & BRANDING RE-WRITE
- Rename the app header to: "Wealth Health Check (Beta)" (Remove "Totally Naked" - it's too risky).
- Remove the fake social proof stats ("100 Cr+ Assets"). Replace them with a simple badge: "Open Source Logic / Client-Side Privacy."
- Change the "Upload Instructions" text to:
  "Upload your CAS PDF from CAMS/Karvy. 
  Password is usually your PAN (lowercase) + DOB (DDMMYYYY)."

### 4. LEGAL COMPLIANCE (SEBI/RBI Safeguards)
- Search and Replace all "Advice" terminology with "Information" terminology:
    - REPLACE "Switch to Direct" -> WITH "Direct Plan Savings Calculator"
    - REPLACE "Out-of-Form" -> WITH "High Expense Ratio Flag"
    - REPLACE "Hidden commissions eat 40%..." -> WITH "Direct plans can save up to ~1% annually in fees."
- Add this Disclaimer in the footer (small text):
  "Disclaimer: This tool is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice. We are not a SEBI-registered investment advisor. Market data is approximate. Consult a professional before making financial decisions."

### 5. FEATURE UPDATES
- In the Results view, instead of just showing "Red/Green" flags, show a calculated column: "Estimated 20-Year Savings".
- Formula: `Current Value * (1.01^20 - 1)` (Approximation of 1% fee difference compounded over 20 years). Label it: "Potential Savings vs Regular Plan".
