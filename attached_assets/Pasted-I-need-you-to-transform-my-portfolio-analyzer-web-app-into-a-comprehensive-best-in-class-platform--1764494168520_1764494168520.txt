I need you to transform my portfolio analyzer web app into a comprehensive, best-in-class platform. Below are the detailed requirements:

## CURRENT STATE
My app is a basic portfolio auditor with a simple landing page showing features. It needs a complete redesign and feature enhancement.

## PHASE 1: LANDING PAGE REDESIGN

### Hero Section
1. Create a modern hero section with:

   - Add animated elements for visual appeal

2. Add two prominent CTA buttons:
   - Primary: "Analyze My Portfolio - Free" (large, gradient button)
   - Secondary: "See How It Works" (outlined button)
   - Primary button should scroll smoothly to the upload section

3. Add trust indicators below the CTA:

### Problem-Solution Section

2. "AI Analyzes in 30 Seconds" - Show animated progress visualization (icon: brain/cpu)
3. "Get Actionable Recommendations" - Show report preview (icon: document/chart)
